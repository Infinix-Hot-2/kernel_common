      "message": "Agreed. The code in timekeeping_debug is the same. The only concern is having those prints in the log will appear only with CONFIG_DEBUG_FS. And in the earlier option we could have it enabled without the debug.\n\nNot sure if a print in timekeeping.c would be a better option since having the prints in the dmesg gives us a better understanding of time passed. What are your thoughts on the same?",
