      "message": "Hrm. This makes a lot of sense given that multipath leaks into this file.  For my taste, it\u0027d be ideal if a new helper was exposed that let the targets add the env vars they wanted then sent it.\n\nAs is, this seems sane to try upstream and see what they say.  I wouldn\u0027t be surprised if they decide that 1 is okay but 2\u0027s a crowd and ask for a generalized helper.  If not, then you\u0027re golden :)\n\nFrom the verity perspective, I\u0027m wondering if there\u0027s a good way to have this also do kernel notification rather than relying on udev to hear and respond. I\u0027m guessing the worst case is lots of -EIOs, so maybe it\u0027s sane to delegate it userland for the error case.  For CrOS, we used a kernel notifier, but it got stripped out of the rewrite that landed upstream.  If this goes upstream, then we\u0027ll migrate over to uevent and drop out out of tree handler.",
