      "message": "It only prints when user is writing to sysfs. I think that won\u0027t happen often, right? Internally we only set timer_rate during boot, so we would at most see it once. The reason we print is that we treat this more of a user error than a valid request, even though we still honor it.\n\nWe added this to inform user that setting rates like 25/35 doesn\u0027t make sense if jiffy is 10ms. People tuning for performance and power don\u0027t necessary know the code, and they might be confused why 15 vs 20 or 25 vs 30 timer_rate doesn\u0027t make any difference. They could also be setting delays based on 15/25 rate. It happened internally so we added this print.",
