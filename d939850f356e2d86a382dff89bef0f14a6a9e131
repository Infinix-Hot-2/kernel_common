I understand that this is a copy and paste from kernel/sched/core.c\n\nThis is counter-intuitive, annoying, duplicating and \"correct\" behavior.\n\nTo make this less painful, could we instead do something like cpu_cgroup_allow_attach() is wrapper for a non-static _cgroup_allow_attach() and call it here rather than pasting it in? I would even accept a direct call to a non-static cpu_cgroup_allow_attach for KISS and low-impact.",
