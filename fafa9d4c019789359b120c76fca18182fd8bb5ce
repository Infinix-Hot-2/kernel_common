      "message": "Sorry about that. This is result of an earlier patch from me: commit d218ed773915 (\"cpufreq: Return index from cpufreq_frequency_table_target()\"). The return value of cpufreq_frequency_table_target() isn\u0027t required to be checked anymore. And the if (ret) lines must simply be dropped.\n\nI would also suggest you to rather pick all the patches from here, which has this already fixed. This branch also has patches for idle-exit notifiers, which Interactive governor always used.\n\nhttps://git.kernel.org/cgit/linux/kernel/git/vireshk/pm.git/log/?h\u003dcpufreq/interactive-idle-notifier",
