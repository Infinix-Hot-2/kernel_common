      "message": "continuation of my thoughts on the following patch:\nI don\u0027t think there is any restriction on calling this after boot.  You could get all the stuff that is current platform data from userspace at runtime, and rename this from \"dummy\" to \"user\" or something, and then it might be enough to use on future real devices.",

I guess the heaps could create directories like /sys/devices/.../ion/heaps/system/, and then writing the size, id, and name to files in that directory would cause a heap to get instantiated.",
