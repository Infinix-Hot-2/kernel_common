      "message": "We need the static buf to have guaranteed memory for crucial operations. This patch was made a while back. The spinlock here is held for very brief time, i dont want to change the design at this late stage. we are also looping quickly through the 16 such buffers, test_bit will be atomic per instructions, i think here the code wants the full check as protected and since the looping is extremely brief i dont think spinlock is much of an issue here....",
