      "message": "Nit: maybe make this a flag instead of an enum?\n\nfrom_user is legacy of the design of this feature, used to be a (boolean) int; where non-zero value references that the page came from the user. In the future it may become a problem if more values are added. For example, and this is a stretch, what if one has PSTORE_FROM_VMALLOC which would trigger the bottom end to free the buffer once it is done with it? Rename to buf_id to more closely associate it with buf, and to ensure it has a future.\n\nThe compressed boolean (int) is upstream, we maybe should overload it\u0027s location and define this a buf_flag with a bit for compressed source? That is a better choice, they placed compressed to just after buf, whereas I put from_user after buffer size.\n\nThis solves a shape change issue with the function, the callers that only have compressed will have a zero or one there, the FROM field is zero, we will denote as PSTORE_FROM_KERNEL as expected.",

      "message": "FYI, tried the port to replace bool compressed with int flags, the impact is more than expected as read, write and write_buf are all rewritten. I decided that should be split from this change as a dependency to this one as part of a patch group. It will require that the back-port to 3.10 will require the compressed pstore patch first to make this easy ...",
