      "message": "There are many mmc requests that can be made to an mmc chips, but I\u0027m only interested in read, write and the various erase/trim methods.  Even erase is tricky, as it involves 3 (or 4 in the case of secure trim) emmc commands to complete.  Putting the tracing at this level, includes a small amount of overhead that I would not get if I traced inside mmc_start_req() and also mmc_request_done(), but I do get traces that show what I want, and no more.",
