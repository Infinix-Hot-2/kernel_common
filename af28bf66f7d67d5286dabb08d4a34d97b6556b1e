For example, we\u0027ll have to change how we enforce above hispeed delay, etc.\n\nJunjie and I were just about to upload a bunch of changes we made on our internal tree. We\u0027ll upload it tomorrow or day after. So, if we can pick those up instead, I think it would work out better for all of us.",
