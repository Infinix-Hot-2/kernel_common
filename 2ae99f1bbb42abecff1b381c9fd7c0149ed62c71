I don\u0027t know if misc_deregister waits for all that work to complete before it returns. If it does, or the remaining work does not access that data you free, then it should be safe as is.",

I usually see binder init complete within 3 seconds of kernel start, well before userspace init is even executed. But I\u0027m not sure this is guaranteed.\n\nHow could misc_deregister() wait for work to complete - it doesn\u0027t know about it?",
