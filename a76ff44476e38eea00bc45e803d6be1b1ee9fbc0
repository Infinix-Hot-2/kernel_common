      "message": "Do we want to calculate the load since the last cpu speed change?\n\nCorrect me if I\u0027m wrong, but in the case where CPU is at max (1ghz) for 10 seconds, then the load suddenly drops, it will take some time before the CPU lowers its speed.\n\nThe ondemand governor uses X as a sample period (30-40ms on Nexus One), so actually in this case we keep the cpu running higher for longer burning more power.\n\nIt might be better to look at the load for the last X ms, ie the last min_sample_time for that CPU, so the governor ramps down quickly.",
