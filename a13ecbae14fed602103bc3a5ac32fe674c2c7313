      "message": "floor_freq is not redundant actually so I kept it in latest patch.\n\nSay frequency X \u003c Y \u003c Z. target_freq and floor_freq is Y and policy-\u003emax is Z. Thermal driver scales down policy-\u003emax to X, and we would rewrite target_freq with X in GOV_LIMITS. Thermal driver then restores policy-\u003emax to Z. This could all happen within a window. We would have target_freq \u003d\u003d X and floor_freq \u003d Y. In this case, I feel it\u0027s more correct to enforce frequency Y instead of X.",
