      "message": "This logic is used to determine which packet should go before the other. PPTP uses 32-bit sequences, so sequences will wrap around UINT32_MAX. As a result, we know that 2 should go before 3 and 0xffffffff should go before 0.\n\nYour examples shows two sequences on the opposite sides of 32-bit space. It will not happen due to the check in line 102. Even it happens, there is no way to tell which one should go first.",
