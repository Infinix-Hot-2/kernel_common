      "message": "This logic is used to determine which packet should go before the other. PPTP uses 32-bit sequences, so sequences will wrap around UINT32_MAX. As a result, we know that 2 should go before 3 and 0xffffffff should go before 0.\n\nYour examples shows two sequences on the opposite sides of 32-bit space. It will not happen due to the check in line 102. Even it happens, there is no way to tell which one should go first.",

Except at 10Mb/s with tons of small  empty packets :)\n\nIn the other file the wrap around happens at 5Mb/s in 1sec.\n\nA comment is ok, as after 1sec the mishandled packet will be considered lost.",
