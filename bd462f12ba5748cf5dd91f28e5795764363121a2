Not sure about splitting it up into two u8 arguments; we\u0027re already violating davem\u0027s maxim: \"If you write interfaces with more than 4 or 5 function arguments, it\u0027s possible that you and I cannot be friends.ï»¿\".\n2. Not sure about naming it \"token\".  Maybe \"subsystem\" or \"driver\" or anything at all that would be clearer.",
