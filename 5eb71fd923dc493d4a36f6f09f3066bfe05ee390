      "message": "nits for next time:\n\nI understand that his is an UPSTREAM patch, the following advice is what I give if it is not to make the (edited) path to upstream easier. The advice is pedantic with regards to this patch, but easy enough to comply.\n\nBug: is not an upstream compliant footer, add it to the bottom so that it can be \u0027truncated\u0027 out. As it stands it has been placed into the \u0027middle\u0027 of the commit.\n\nChange-Id: is missing. Also not an upstream compliant footer and is a reason to reject into upstream with checkpatch.pl. Historically it was required specifically by Gerrit to be at the bottom, but that requirement disappeared about 3 years ago allowing for some flexibility. I continue to make it the _bottom_ footer out of habit...\n\nWith a Change-Id in the patch comments, we gain the ability to research it in Gerrit, look back at comments garnered in the CLs during review.",
