Ramoops oops/panic logger
=========================

See Documentation/ramoops.txt.  The bindings here are modelled after the ramoops
kernel module parameters.


Required properties:

- compatible: must be "ramoops"

- memory-region: phandle to a region of memory that is preserved between reboots


Optional properties:

- ecc-size: enables ECC support and specifies ECC buffer size in bytes

- record-size: size in bytes of each dump done on oops/panic

- console-size: size in bytes of kernel console log

- ftrace-size: size in bytes of ftrace log

- pmsg-size: size in bytes of user space message log

- unbuffered: if present, use pgprot_noncached to map reserved region
  (defaults to pgprot_writecombine)

- no-dump-oops: if present, only dump panics (defaults to panics and oops)
