eMMC Block layer simulation speed controls in /sys/block/mmcblk*/
===============================================

Turned on with CONFIG_MMC_BLOCK_MAX_SPEED which enables MMC device speed
limiting. Used to test and simulate the behavior of the system when
confronted with a slow MMC.

Enables max_read_speed, max_write_speed and cache_size attributes to control
the write or read maximum KB/second speed behaviors. The defaults are set
by CONFIG_MMC_BLOCK_MAX_READ_SPEED, CONFIG_MMC_BLOCK_MAX_WRITE_SPEED and
CONFIG_MMC_CACHE_SIZE config parameters respectively.

/sys/block/mmcblk0/max_read_speed:

Number of KB/second reads allowed to the block device. Used to test and
simulate the behavior of the system when confronted with a slow reading MMC.
Set to 0 or "off" to place no speed limit.

/sys/block/mmcblk0/max_write_speed:

Number of KB/second writes allowed to the block device. Used to test and
simulate the behavior of the system when confronted with a slow writing MMC.
Set to 0 or "off" to place no speed limit.

/sys/block/mmcblk0/cache_size:

Number of MB of high speed memory or high speed SLC cache expected on the
eMMC device being simulated. Used to help simulate the write-back behavior
more accurately. The assumption is the cache has no delay, but draws down
in the background to the MLC/TLC primary store at the max_write_speed rate.
Any write speed delays will show up when the cache is full, or when an I/O
request to flush is issued.
