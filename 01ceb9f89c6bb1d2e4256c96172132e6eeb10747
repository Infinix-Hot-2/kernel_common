      "message": "The mutex here just makes sure the printk reports the same state as the call to android_bat_charge_source_changed passed.  The wakelock ensures the charger worker can update charger state prior to suspending again.  Grabbing the wakelock didn\u0027t seem to be a part of the state to be kept consistent under the mutex.  But tell me more if I\u0027m missing something.",
