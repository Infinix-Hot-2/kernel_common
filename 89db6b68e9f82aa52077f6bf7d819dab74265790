      "message": "I think this has to be target_freq or we could keep CPU at high freq indefinitely.\n\nImagining two CPUs managed by one policy. CPU A is fully busy and its target_freq is policy-\u003emax, and thus keeping cluster frequency at policy-\u003emax. CPU B is idling at non-min freq with both timer scheduled. (They could be scheduled before CPU A ramped up to policy-\u003emax.)\n\nCPU B wakes up at beginning of the window where slack_timer would fire. Its regulaor timer drops its target_freq to policy-\u003emin because load is 0. With this change, it won\u0027t schedule regular timer, but slack timer is left unchanged.  CPU B does quite a lot of work before going to sleep again in same window. CPU B\u0027s slack time fires at end of this window, sees the busy time CPU B consumed in that window, and ramps up its target_freq to some middle frequency. CPU B\u0027s timers are again not scheduled because CPU A is keeping policy-\u003ecur at policy-\u003emax. If CPU B goes to long idle afterwards, its target_freq will keep policy frequency high forever even if CPU A ramps down to policy-\u003emin later.",
